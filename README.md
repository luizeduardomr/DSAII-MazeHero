# DSAII - MazeHeri
This repository consists of a faculty project for Algorithm and Data Structure ll, which consists of finding the minimum distance between two points in a maze.
</br>
</br>

## Proposed problem
You must find out the shortest path length of the hero to the villain.
- "#" represents an impenetrable wall;
- "." represents free space;
- "A" represents a generic hero who moves up, down, left and right but not diagonally;
- "B" represents a generic villain who is standing around doing his evil plan;

##### In this maze example, we find that the hero needs at least 49 moves to reach the villain.
